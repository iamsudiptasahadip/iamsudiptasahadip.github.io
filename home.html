Being a student from CS background, I'm deeply going into analytics and statistics for improving my expertise in the decision-making field. From a wide<br>
perspective, I have research interests to merge Software, IoT, and Cloud together according to its digital products so that those can be user friendly and<br>
profitable from both the consumer and business ends.

I believe humans are one of the most versatile species on earth and as I am born one of the eight billion human beings, I get encouraged to work on human<br>
behavior and psychology. So, I am having the necessary knowledge of communication and beyond to analyze consumer behavior and marketing thoughts<br>
for up-to-date strategies.
